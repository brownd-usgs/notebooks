#Experimenting with GC2
We are experimenting with the [Mapcentia GC2 platform](http://www.mapcentia.com/en/product/platform.htm), which is a composition of open source projects we've already been using plus some variations. We're trying to get up an running an online, fully API-driven data platform for aspects of our Biogeographic Information System that don't already fit into [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov) or some other existing infrastructure. We need something that lets our team of biologists and spatial analysts have full control to spin up new data models, containing both spatial and nonspatial data, get things populated, provide API-driven applications on our own, and hand over API end points to a team of web developers we work with on building more refined apps.

We're trying to get ourselves to the point where our data is completely code-driven and immediately online as opposed to the old school methods of downloading and building files locally and then going through some kind of DBA person to get things online. The GC2 platform seems to offer quite a bit of that capability. We worked for a while with the CARTO platform, but we got stymied when we tried to get that whole composition of slightly different open source components launched on Amazon AWS. We may run into the same issues when we go to do that with GC2, but for now, we've got more disc space to work with through their own online offering and they seem to have a better system of Dockerized containers to work from in deploying to cloud.
